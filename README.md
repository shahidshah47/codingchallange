This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).



## Challenge Description
The goal of this coding challenge is to create a mobile app with the following features:

- **Login Screen**: Implement Google login and email/password login with basic form validation.
- **Authenticated Home Screen**: Display a greeting message based on the user's time of day and pop up a bottom sheet with two radio buttons that make HTTP calls to fetch and render lists of items (todos and posts).
- **Profile Page**: Show user information and a logout button.
- **Item Page**: Display item details with a back button to the home screen.
